# GPA Calculator

## Project Description
The GPA Calculator is a user-friendly web-based tool designed to assist students in calculating their Grade Point Average (GPA) quickly and accurately. Users can input their personal details and subject scores, enabling real-time GPA updates. The calculator employs a credit-based system to ensure consistency across different grading scales and institutions. Key features include dynamic subject addition, instant GPA display, and PDF generation for future reference. The tool aims to save time, enhance accuracy, and offer flexibility, making it an essential resource for academic planning and tracking.
